        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>When the weather is hot, there is almost nothing that I crave more than crunchy, 
            healthy veggies (especially when paired with a refreshing drink). This easy vegetable salad is 
            packed with a variety of summer produce with all the textures and colors I could ever want.</p>

         <p> And don’t feel limited by that particular mix of veggies, either! Add or swap in any of 
            your favorite veggies like earthy beets or sweet bell peppers. You can also opt to use any 
            grilled or cooked veggies that you like – summer squash, zucchini or mushrooms are all lovely options.</p>
